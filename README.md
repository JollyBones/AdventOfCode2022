# Advent of Code 2022

## 1. What is the Advent of Code?

The Advent of Code program is a challenge set to all programmers around the
world to complete one coding exercise every day from the 1st of December all the
way to Christmas Day. Each challenge consists of two parts, each of which is
contextually related to the other. You can use any language you want to complete
the challenges, and there's no requirement to use the same language every day.

Each day at 1pm AWST (+8 UTC), the new challenge is unlocked and is made
available for all programmers. You can see each of the currently unlocked
challenges [here](https://adventofcode.com/).

The overview of the program is detailed
[here](https://adventofcode.com/2022/about).

## 2. How are you completing this?

I'm using Typescript and Deno.

## 3. How do I run one of your solutions

Execute the following command from the root of the project:

```sh
npx ts-node ./solutions/day-<TARGET-DAY>/part-<TARGET-PART>.ts
```

For example:

```sh
npx ts-node ./solutions/day-1/part-1.ts
```
